 m9u is a little awkward to package, because it doesn't actually do anything
with the music. m9u works with a list of files, and relies on other binaries
to decode and play them (hey, it's the UNIX way ;) ).
 m9u uses a script (m9play) to decide what player is appropriate for a given
file. There's no magic involved - the script is simple because it is tied to
a specific environment (in this case, my environment: a mish-mash of command
line players with an ALSA backend).
 Closely related is the m9title script, which is not used by m9u itself, but
is useful for anything listening to /event. m9title's responsibility is that
of providing a mapping from filename to "presentable title".
 Anyway, what I'm getting at is these scripts should be changed to match the
environment they are installed in. One day I might include several different
implementations in the distribution, but for the moment I'm leaving the task
to the user/distributor.
